#X text 20 77 The Raspberry Pi's GPIO header exposes several SPI buses.
SPI0 is available on all Raspberry Pi models. SPI1 is available on
models with a 40-pin header. SPI2 is only available on the Compute
and Compute 3. SPI3 through SPI6 are only available on the Raspberry
Pi 4B \, 400 and 5.;
#X text 58 178 SPI0 is disabled by default. You can enable it by running
sudo raspi-config \, or by manually adding dtparam=spi=on to \/boot\/firmware\/config.txt.The
associated pins are listed below:;
#X text 96 264 MOSI: BCM GPIO 10 (physical pin 19) SCLK: BCM GPIO 11
(physical pin 23) SS: Ss0 BCM GPIO 8 (physical pin 24) \, Ss1 BCM GPIO
7 (physical pin 26);
